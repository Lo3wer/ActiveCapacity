# AtCapacity - SaaS

## IDEA

A standardized SaaS that displays capacity metrics of common facilities (e.g., gyms, courts, drop-in classes) to users.

## Context

Many sports and recreational facilities operate on a drop-in basis, making it difficult for users to gauge occupancy and wait times before arriving.

## Users

- Gym-goers
- People attending drop-in classes
- Recreational center visitors
- Gyms using it to gauge their own metrics

## Problem

Currently, there is no standardized way to check the number of people or wait times at drop-in facilities such as gyms, recreational centers, and drop-in classes. People often have to call or visit in person to determine availability, which is inefficient.

## Solution

A web and mobile application that provides real-time capacity and wait time information for active facilities.
